Fortune's wheel is ever turning.
Fortuna favet fortibus.
I myself am good fortune.
When fortune knocks, open the door.
To attract good fortune, spend a new penny on an old friend, share an old pleasure with a new friend and lift up the heart of a true friend by writing his name on the wings of a dragon. (Chinese proverb)
Fortune befriends the bold. (Emily Dickinson)
A good memory is fine, but the ability to forget is the one true test of greatness.
A faithful friend is a strong defense.
Every flower blooms in its own sweet time.
A truly rich life contains love and art in abundance.
Stand tall. Don't look down upon yourself.
Your mind is your greatest asset.
If you know not to which port you sail, all winds are favourable.
Don't be put off by the time it takes to reach your goals. That time will pass anyway.
