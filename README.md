An interactive Processing sketch in six scenes inspired by mosaic artwork on one of the buildings on campus, The Ladies of the Four Seasons.

### Goals to meet assessment criteria
- Theme: Keele Interaction
- Informative header and concise comments
- Any interaction requirements should be made clear with on-screen guidance for the user
- Credits that document and clearly outline aspects of code, used media, animation and programming in detail

### Used technologies
Processing (Java), GIMP

### Timeline
Coded and completed in April-May 2022. Absolutely would have needed version control during the coding process but alas, here we are, adding the final product onto git almost a year later. Live and learn
